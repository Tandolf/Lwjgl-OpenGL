# Lwjgl-OpenGL

This is my test project for trying out and learning more about LWJGL and OpenGL. It is basically a 3D square in an empty space that you can fly around using the ”AWSD”-keys and the mouse in an first person view.

it’s run with:

-    LWJGL 2.9.3
-    JGLU (Java OpenGL Mathematics Library) 1.0.0
-    Java 1.7 or higher

## Install instructions

Clone the project and build it. After build you must set the natives. In eclipse **right click on project > build path > configure build path > source** and then you’ll se **”native library location”** here you set the location.

After you have buildt the project, natives location will be at:

-    *<project>/Target/natives -folder*

Set that folder as native location. Then just run the project as a java application. And start flying around!
