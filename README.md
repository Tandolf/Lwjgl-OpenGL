# Lwjgl-OpenGL
<br>
This is my testprojekt for trying out LWJGL 2.9.3. It is basically a 3D square in an empty space that you can fly around using the ”AWSD”-keys and the mouse in an first person view.<br>
<br>
it’s run with:<br>
<br>
:*LWJGL 2.9.3
:*JGLU (Java OpenGL Mathematics Library) 1.0.0
:*Java 1.7 or higher<br>
<br>
## Installation instructions
——<br>
Clone the project and build it. After build you mest set the natives. In eclipse ’’’right click on project > build path > configure build path > source’’’ and then you’ll se ”native library location”.<br>
<br>
After you have build the project, natives will be placed in the:<br> 
<br>
:*<project>/Target/natives -folder
<br>
Set that folder as native location. Then just run the project it as a java application.
