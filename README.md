# Lwjgl-OpenGL

This is my testprojekt for trying out LWJGL 2.9.3. It is basically a 3D square in an empty space that you can fly around using the ”AWSD”-keys and the mouse in an first person view.

it’s run with:

-    LWJGL 2.9.3
-    JGLU (Java OpenGL Mathematics Library) 1.0.0
-    Java 1.7 or higher

## Installation instructions

Clone the project and build it. After build you mest set the natives. In eclipse *right click on project > build path > configure build path > source* and then you’ll se *”native library location”*.

After you have build the project, natives will be placed in the:

-    *<project>/Target/natives -folder*

Set that folder as native location. Then just run the project it as a java application.
